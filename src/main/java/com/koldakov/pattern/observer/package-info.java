/**
 * Based on https://java2blog.com/observer-design-pattern-in-java
 *
 * It can be thought of as publish-subscribe pattern
 *
 * Observers register (subscribe) in observable object
 * When observable object's state changes,
 * it notifies (publishes) its observers (subscribers)
 *
 * Base of this pattern is also implemented in java.util
